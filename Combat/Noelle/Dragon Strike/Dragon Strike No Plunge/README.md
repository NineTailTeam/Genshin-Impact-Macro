For AHK script, run as Administrator. Change Hotkey key to any key you would use. Default: `/~. Swing Time should be as low as possible, but still be large enough for the macro to consistantly climb.

For most consistency, activate macro after first strike with auto-attack. Logitech macro is inconsistent.
